Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

A set is a collection which is both unordered and unindexed.
Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.

Sets are written with curly brackets{}.
