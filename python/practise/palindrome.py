Q1.
WAP in to check wether the input string is palindrome or not using function.

eg: madam >> palindrome
    hari >> not palindrome
    mom >> palindrome 
    dad >> palindrome 
    eye >> palindrome

Q2. 
Write a program to find the number of trailing zeroes in a given factorial.

Example 1:

Input: 4
Output: 0
Explanation: 4!(4*3*2*1) = 24, no trailing zero.

Example 2:
Input: 6
Output: 1
Explanation: 6!(6*5*4*3*2*1) = 720, one trailing zero. numbers = 720 numbers[0] , [1], [2]

Example:
Input:
n = 4
n = 5 (5*4*3*2*1 = 120) 
Output:
Number of trailing zeroes of factorial 4 is 0
Number of trailing zeroes of factorial 5 is 1


Q3.
Write a program to count the total number of digit 1 appearing in all positive integers less than or equal to a given integer n. 
Example:
Input n = 12,
Return 5, because digit 1 occurred 5 times in the following numbers: 1, 10, 11, 12.
Example:
Input:
n = 12
n = 30 (1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21)
Output:
Total number of digit 1 appearing in 12 (less than or equal) is 5.
Total number of digit 1 appearing in 30 (less than or equal) is 13.
